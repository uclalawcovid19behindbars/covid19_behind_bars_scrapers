#' Scraper class for North Carolina vaccine data 
#' 
#' @name north_carolina_vaccine_scraper
#' @description In early March, NC began reporting statewide totals for vaccine data 
#' directly on their main COVID-19 dashboard. They also report vaccination data by 
#' race/ethnicity, not scraped. They include the following note about staff vaccinations
#' "Numbers represent Adult Correction staff who have been vaccinated by NCDPS and 
#' who have self-reported if they were vaccinated by an outside provider. Staff 
#' vaccination is voluntary. Vaccination information is protected through HIPAA." 
#' 
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Partially Vaccinated}{Individuals who have received the initial shot and 
#'   are waiting the required time before receiving the second dose.}
#'   \item{Fully Vaccinated}{Individuals who have received all required doses of the vaccine.}
#' }
