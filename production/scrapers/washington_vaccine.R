#' Scraper class for Washington vaccine data

#' @name washington_vaccine_scraper
#' @description WA has a number of html tables on their vaccine page with both facility
#' specific and state-wide information. Currently only pulling data from the 
#' vaccine administration status by facility table. This table displays the total count 
#' of vaccines administered by the Department of Corrections to include an analysis 
#' of initiated vaccine counts (1st dose received) and second vaccine counts 
#' (2nd dose received) by facility. Vaccine facilities are approved by the Department 
#' of Health as vaccine storage sites. Vaccines given at Corrections' Headquarters 
#' (HQ) are included in Washington Corrections Center's count.
