# Unsucessful Scrapers 

**Which scrapers didn't run successfully?**

The table below summarizes the scrapers that yielded errors and warnings. Highlighted rows yielded errors, meaning no data was extracted.

``` {r echo = F, warning = F}
# Read latest facility data 
new_df <- read_scrape_data(all_dates = FALSE)

# Get all log files from the latest run 
log_files <- behindbarstools::list_remote_data("log_files")

latest_date <- unique(stringr::str_extract(log_files, "\\d+-\\d+-\\d+")) %>%
    as.Date() %>%
    max()

log_status <- log_files %>%
    str_subset(pattern = as.character(latest_date)) %>%
    as_tibble_col(column_name = "log") %>% 
    mutate(scraper = str_extract(log, "(?<=log_files/).*"))%>% 
    mutate(error = map(log, 
         ~read_file(.) %>% 
           str_detect(., "(?i)error")) %>%

```

**How many scrapers were too old to scrape from (`error_on_date`)?** 

There were `r log_status %>% filter(error_on_date == TRUE) %>% nrow()` scrapers that errored on date. They were:

```{r error-on-date, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
kable(log_status %>% 
          select(-log) %>%
          filter(error_on_date == TRUE),
      col.names = c("Scraper", "Status", "Error on Date")) %>%     
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    column_spec(1, border_right = "1px solid #d2d2d2") %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

# Comparison to Previous Run

## Aggregate Totals 

**How do the cumulative totals compare to the previous scraped data?** 

We expect all cumulative variables to increase with each subsequent scraper run. Rows highlighted below indicate that the aggregated total for a given variable fell in the latest scrape. This is based on totals from our scraped data in `adult_facility_covid_counts.csv`. 

``` {r check_previous, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# Read old national aggregate counts 
old_total <- stringr::str_c(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/data/master/", 
    "latest-data/latest_national_counts.csv") %>% 
  read_csv() %>%
  rename(`Old Total` = Count)

covid_suffixes <- c(
  ".Confirmed", ".Deaths", ".Tadmin", ".Active", ".Initiated", ".Completed")

# Get totals 
rowAny <- function(x) rowSums(x) > 0

new_total <- read_csv("../data/latest-data/latest_national_counts.csv") %>%
  rename(`New Total` = Count)

joined <- full_join(old_total, new_total, by = "Measure") %>% 
  mutate(Difference = `New Total` - `Old Total`,
         Pct_Increase = (Difference / `Old Total` )*100) %>% 
  mutate(cumulative_flag = ifelse(str_detect(Measure, ".Active|.Initiated|.Completed"), 0, 1)) %>%
  select(-starts_with("Missing"),
         -starts_with("Reporting"))

# Highlight cumulative variables that decreased 
kable(joined %>% select(-cumulative_flag), format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    column_spec(1, border_right = "1px solid #d2d2d2") %>% 
    row_spec(which(joined$Difference < 0 & joined$cumulative_flag == 1), 
             background = "#ffa07a") %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

## By Facility

**Which facilities have metrics that are declining that shouldn't be?**

This is also based on totals from our scraped data in `adult_facility_covid_counts.csv` and includes facilities across all jurisdictions. Declining cumulative cases and deaths for incarcerated people are highlighted except from Texas, Ohio, and the BOP (where we know reported counts are not cumulative). 

``` {r check_previous_facility, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
old_df <- stringr::str_c(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/data/master/", 
    "latest-data/latest_facility_counts.csv") %>% 
    read_csv()
old_facility <- old_df %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Facility.ID)) %>% 
    filter(rowAny(across(ends_with(covid_suffixes), ~ !is.na(.x)))) %>%
    select(Facility.ID, State, Jurisdiction, Name, all_of(ends_with(covid_suffixes))) %>%  
    pivot_longer(cols = ends_with(covid_suffixes), 
                 names_to = "Variable", 
                 values_to = "Old Value")

new_facility <- new_df %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Facility.ID)) %>% 
    filter(rowAny(across(ends_with(covid_suffixes), ~ !is.na(.x)))) %>%
    select(Facility.ID, all_of(ends_with(covid_suffixes))) %>%  
    pivot_longer(cols = ends_with(covid_suffixes), 
                 names_to = "Variable", 
                 values_to = "New Value")

joined_facility <- full_join(old_facility, new_facility, 
                             by = c("Facility.ID", "Variable")) %>% 
    mutate(Difference = `New Value` - `Old Value`) %>% 
    filter(str_detect(Variable, ".Confirmed|.Deaths")) %>% 
    mutate(known_issues = ifelse(
        Jurisdiction == "federal" | State %in% c("Texas", "Ohio") & Jurisdiction == "state", 
        1, 0)) %>% 
    filter(Difference < 0) %>% 
    arrange(known_issues, Difference) %>% 
    select(-Facility.ID)

kable(joined_facility, format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    row_spec(which(joined_facility$Variable %in% c("Residents.Confirmed", "Residents.Deaths") 
                   & joined_facility$known_issues == 0), 
             background = "#ffa07a") %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

## By State 

**Which states have metrics that are declining that shouldn't be in aggregate?**

This compares to the state-aggregated totals in `state_aggregate_counts.csv` which excludes county jails and treats federal and immigration facilities as separate rows. 

```{r check_previous_state, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# Read latest statewide data 
new_state_df <- behindbarstools::calc_aggregate_counts(state = TRUE)

# Read old data 
old_state_df <- stringr::str_c(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/data/master/", 
    "latest-data/latest_state_counts.csv") %>% 
    read_csv()

measure_decline_df <- full_join(
    new_state_df %>%   
       filter(!is.na(Val)) %>%
        select(State, Measure, Val) %>% 
        rename("New Total" = "Val"), 
    
    old_state_df %>% 
        pivot_longer(-State, names_to = "Measure", values_to = "Old Total"), 
    
    by = c("State", "Measure")
    ) %>% 
    mutate(Difference = `New Total` - `Old Total`) %>% 
    filter(Difference < 0) %>% 
    filter(stringr::str_ends(
        Measure, ".Confirmed|.Deaths|.Tadmin|.Tested|.Initiated|.Completed"))

kable(measure_decline_df, format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

---

# Comparison to CPP 
``` {r, echo = F}
cpp_df <- behindbarstools::read_cpp_data()

new_state_df %>% 
    left_join(cpp_df %>% 
                  rename(Date.CPP = Date) %>% 
                  pivot_longer(!c(State, Date.CPP), names_to = "Measure", values_to = "CPP"), 
              by = c("State", "Measure")) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(UCLA) & !is.na(CPP)) %>% 
    filter(str_detect(Measure, "Confirmed|Deaths")) %>% 
    mutate(diff = abs((UCLA - CPP) / CPP)) %>% 
    filter(diff != 0) %>% 
    arrange(desc(diff)) %>% 
    select(State, Measure, UCLA, CPP, Date.UCLA, Date.CPP) %>% 
    kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

# Comparison to AP/TMP

**How does our aggregated data compare to data from AP and the Marshall Project?** 

AP and the Marshall Project report [data on COVID in prisons at the state-level](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons) each week. Because of differences in our methodology (e.g. data sources, update frequency, etc.), we do NOT expect our statewide totals to perfectly align with data from AP/TMP. The table below includes states where our totals differ by more than 20% OR where TMP is reporting values higher than we are. 

``` {r, echo = F}
new_state_df %>% 
    filter(!is.na(UCLA) & !is.na(MP)) %>% 
    filter(str_detect(Measure, "Confirmed|Deaths")) %>% 
    mutate(diff = abs((UCLA - MP) / MP)) %>% 
    filter(diff != 0) %>% 
    arrange(desc(diff)) %>% 
    select(State, Measure, UCLA, MP) %>% 
    kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>% 
    scroll_box(height = "300px")
```
