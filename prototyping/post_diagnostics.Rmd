# Unsucessful Scrapers 

**Which scrapers didn't run successfully?**

The table below summarizes the scrapers that yielded errors and warnings. Highlighted rows yielded errors, meaning no data was extracted.

``` {r echo = F, warning = F}
# Read latest scraped data 
new_df <- read_scrape_data()

# Get all log files from the latest run 
latest_date <- max(new_df$Date) %>% 
    as.character()

log_status <- list_remote_data("log_files") %>% 
    str_subset(pattern = latest_date) %>% 
    as_tibble_col(column_name = "log") %>% 
    mutate(scraper = str_extract(log, "(?<=log_files/).*"))%>% 
    mutate(status = map(log, ~ read_file(.) %>% word(1)) %>% unlist()) 

# Highlight scrapers with errors   
kable(log_status %>% 
          select(-log), 
      col.names = c("Scraper", "Status")) %>%     
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "striped")) %>%

# Comparison to Previous Run

**How do the cumulative totals compare to the previous scraped data?** 

We expect all cumulative variables to increase with each subsequent scraper run. Rows highlighted below indicate that the aggregated total for a given variable fell in the latest scrape. The table compares data from the latest scrape to what is currently on [the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk/edit#gid=1641553906). 

``` {r check_previous, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# Read existing Google sheet data 
old_df <- "1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk" %>%
    read_sheet(sheet = 2, skip = 1) %>%

# Comparison to AP/TMP

**How does our aggregated data compare to data from AP and the Marshall Project?** 

AP and the Marshall Project report [data on COVID in prisons at the state-level](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons) each week. Because of differences in our methodology (e.g. data sources, update frequency, etc.), we do NOT expect our statewide totals to perfectly align with data from AP/TMP. The table below highlights states where our totals differ by more than 20%. 

``` {r, echo = F}
